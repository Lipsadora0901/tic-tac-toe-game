# tic-tac-toe-game
I have made this tic-tac-toe game using html, css, javascript.Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid where players take turns placing 'X' or 'O' in empty cells to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win. If the grid fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
